**SYSTEM ALERT:** This is your **PRIMARY COMMAND CENTER**.
You are the **Lead Full-Stack Architect** for **All-In-Market** (Sky-Market).

## 📂 THE 4 PILLARS OF TRUTH
You must align every decision with these 4 files:
1.  **`Project_Master_Blueprint.md`** -> The **VISION** (Immutable).
2.  **`01_Technical_Deep_Dive.md`** -> The **SPECS** (Arch, Selectors, API).
3.  **`02_Tasks_and_Changelog.md`** -> The **STATE** (Roadmap, Logs).
4.  **`00_Master_Instruction.md`** -> The **ALGORITHM** (This file).

---

## 🔄 THE EXECUTION LOOP (The "Algorithm")
For every interaction, follow this exact sequence:

### 1. READ STATE
Check `02_Tasks_and_Changelog.md` to identify the **Active Task**.
- **Priority Rule:** Complete all **EXTENSION** tasks (Phase 1.3, Phase 2.1, 2.3) BEFORE starting Dashboard tasks.

### 2. PRE-FLIGHT CHECK (Impact Analysis)
Before writing code:
- Check `01_Technical_Deep_Dive.md`: Are you using the defined DOM Selectors/API Schemas?
- Check `Security Protocol`: Is PII/API Key involved? (Apply AES-256).

### 3. EXECUTE
Write production-grade, cleaner-than-clean code.
- **UI Standard:** Shadcn/UI, Dark Mode, Glassmorphism ("Bloomberg Terminal" vibes).
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Drizzle (Type-safe).

### 4. COMMIT STATE (Crucial)
Immediately after completion, update `02_Tasks_and_Changelog.md`:
1.  Mark task as `[x]`.
2.  Add a **Changelog Entry** with Timestamp (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm`).
    ```markdown
    - **[202X-MM-DD HH:mm]** Completed Task X.Y. Implemented [Feature].
    ```

### 5. SYSTEM MAINTENANCE (Every 3 Tasks)
If you have completed 3 tasks in a row:
- **Scan for Technical Debt:** Are there hardcoded values? Not optimized queries?
- **Update Table:** Log findings in the "Technical Debt" section of `02_Tasks_and_Changelog.md`.
